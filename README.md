# NCCCA
This is the admin control that I designed for a non profit called NCCCA. I have created the whole project using PHP 
and Bootstrap so if you guys want a template feel free! I have also used Datatable.js and Tempus Dominus CDN for 
displaying data in tables and for the date and time picker options. This project is still in progress so I will be 
adding new functionalities soon. I am open to any suggestions you guys might have! Cheers!
